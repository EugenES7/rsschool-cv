## About me

Throughout my life I've always been interested in the exact sciences and technical disciplines.
I graduated the Engineering Academy, received a specialist degree and worked in the construction industry (started my career as a foreman, then worked my way up to a construction project manager).
Despite my experience, I was always interested in learning something new, so I decided to try myself at the IT field.
I've always been distinguished by  desire for self-improvement and acquiring new knowledge.
I take education very seriously and I'm not afraid of difficulties.
I always set high goals for myself and now the aim of my studies is to reach an excellent level of a front-end specialist within a year.
